	Purpose: {
		This section holds lower-level C strings used in various parts
		of the system. This section is unique, because it constructs a
		single C string that contains all the specified strings below.
		This is done to eliminate series headers required for normal
		REBOL strings. The strings are referenced using Boot_Strs[RS_*]
		where * is the set-word (and is zero based). For example:
		RS_SCAN+3 refers to "end-of-paren"
